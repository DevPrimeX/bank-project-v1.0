The Bank Management System is a console-based Python application developed to handle essential banking tasks, such as account creation, deposits, withdrawals, and transaction tracking. It connects to a MySQL database, ensuring secure and structured storage of user data. The system provides users with a straightforward interface for managing their financial information, while the backend uses SQL for database operations. By utilizing Python's built-in libraries and MySQL for data management, this project demonstrates a basic banking system with functions for registration, authentication, transaction handling, and account management. With user authentication protocols and input validation, the Bank Management System ensures a user-friendly experience and data integrity, serving as a practical example of database-driven application development in Python.
